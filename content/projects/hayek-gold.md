**User Research**


**Information Architecture** 

The menu and different case scenarios for the actions needed to take place within the platform. 


**User Flow**

I created user flows to reduce the amount of clicks involved during the signup process, which demonstrated the steps taken for the user to achieve the main objective, buying Hayeks, in other words: digital gold coins. 


**Wireframes**

Using a front-end UI kit, I used it as the base to put together the wireframes. There wasn’t much time to go through the proper UX workflow, but still managed to have solid prototypes.

**Designing the app’s Dashboard**

I was able to create the full high fidelity prototype in front-end code. And had it hosted on Heroku for quick uploads. <a href="https://anthemgold.herokuapp.com/views/overview.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Click here to preview this prototype</a>. The progress was presented to the company’s product manager and team members for more internal testings to help guide and find areas which needed improvements. Taking this approach really eliminated a lot of time that would of had been spent if I were to design this the traditional way.

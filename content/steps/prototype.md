This step allows me to explore and highlight problems in the wireframes on the early stage, without drawing up high-fidelity layouts, while still representing the core functionality.

Then the team and I, test this early prototype live. Which can also be tested by a group of users from the target audience.

This testing is a shortcut to the common waterfall approach, because it reduces costs and resources for future user testing and redesigns after the product has already been deployed.

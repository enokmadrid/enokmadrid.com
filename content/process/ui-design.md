After a solid foundation, I proceed into my favorite part of this process: designing. This is where I start putting together actual deliverables.

Normally, I will create style tiles, ui elements, visual assets like icons, illustrations and graphics where necessary.

**Interactive Prototype**  
After building out the high-fidelity mock-ups in Sketch App, I proceed to present the design as an interactive prototype Invision App for client approval.

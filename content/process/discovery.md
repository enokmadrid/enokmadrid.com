I begin most projects by gathering as much information possible. Interview stakeholders to uncover business goals and figure out how I’ll measure success. This allows me to grasp a solid understanding of the problems that need to be solved.

If it’s an existing product, I’ll sometimes run analytics and run some user tests.

Otherwise, if it’s a new product, I create user stories, scenarios, and user flows to find the best experience for the end user.
